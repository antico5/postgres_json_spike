HSTORE

- Key/value based store
- Doesn't allow nesting
- Supports only strings

JSON

- Is stored as text
- Indentation and formatting is kept
- Postgres validates it's json
- Good write throughput
- Good if you don't query it as much

JSONB

- JSON Better
- It's compressed
- Allows nested structures
- Allows all basic data types


Good use cases:
- Tracking events with lots of different metadata
- Games or applications where schema is flexible and changes over time
- Models that have diverse attributes associated. I.e Products -> Books (author, publish date), clothes(color, sizes), cellphones(camera, ram, screen size)

My use case
- Tracking of creation, update and deletion of records
